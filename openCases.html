    <p>
      Me and holmes are currently looking into an abduction case. A man came to
      us claiming he was compensated handsomely for translating Greek in order
      to communicate with a chained up masked man. While it sounds incredibly
      odd we shall make every endeavor to get to the bottom of it.

    <p>
      Two murder cases 20 years apart. I cannot see any connection between them
      but Holmes insists that the key to solving this new murder depends on an
      old crime lodge that used to rule the valley.
