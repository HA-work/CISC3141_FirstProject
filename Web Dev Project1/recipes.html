      Here is the recipe for Mrs. Hudson's famous afternoon tea. Sometimes the
      simple things are best.
    </p>

    <b>Ingredients</b>
    <ul>
      <li>1 Twining's english breakfast tea bag</li>
      <li>Boiling Water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon low-fat milk</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>First, you have to boil the water - don't just heat it, boil it.</li>
      <li>
        Second, add the boiling water to the tea bag, not the other way round. -
        putting the water in the cup and adding the bag to it - is a recipe for
        disaster. Unless the water is at boiling point when it makes contact
        with the tea, the tea will never properly brew.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sure the cup or pot is nice and hot before you start. If necessary,
        rinse it out with near-boiling water. And keep it covered while the tea
        is brewing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Leave the bag in the water for at least two minutes - longer if you like
        your tea strong. And for goodness sake, resist the temptation to dunk.
        Just leave the bag alone until the drink is ready!
      </li>
      <li>Add milk and sugar to taste.</li>
    </ol>
